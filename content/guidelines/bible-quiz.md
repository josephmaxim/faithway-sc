Each school is required to enter 3 students, male or female, per age group. No alternates are allowed.

Each student will study the chosen passage to prepare for this event. The passage will be announced a few months before Convention.

The types of questions will be as follows:

1. People, places, or events found in the context
2. Clear contextual Bible teachings
3. Limited quotation of scripture 

Example of questions:

1. What kind of world did God deliver us from? Galatians 1:4 (clear contextual Bible teachings)
2. Why did Paul go to Jerusalem? Galatians (people, places, or events found in the context)
3. Quote Galatians 1:11 (limited quotation of Scripture)

Each game will consist of 21 questions, plus ones necessary to break a tie. To answer a question, a student must stand to his feet, must be recognized by the quizmaster, and must begin to answer the question within 10 seconds. His answer must be completed within 30 seconds. If a student interrupts a question by standing, he must answer the question without hearing it read in its entirety.

When a question is answered incorrectly, the question will be read again, and the opposing team will then have the opportunity to give the proper response.

An individual will quiz out after answering 5 questions.

If a team feels that a question has been answered incorrectly, they may challenge the answer, and the judges will then reconsider the answer and make a decision.

Students may not consult with each other during the quiz. Doing so will result in a fault and the loss of 10 points.

Questions will be worth 20 points each.

Unanswered questions will be thrown out and asked again during the tournament.

All quotation must be from the King James Version of the Bible.
