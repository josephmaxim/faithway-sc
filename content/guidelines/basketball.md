Each school is allowed to enter two female and two male teams per division only if their school has a registration of more than 25 students. Each student can only play on 1 team.

For those schools with fewer than 25 participants, combining students will be allowed between “A” and “B” division.

There will be 3 players on the court per team.

There can be 6 substitutes allowed for a maximum of 9 players per team.

Each player is to wear a numbered jersey. Please follow the DRESS CODE for Convention.

Free throws will be given for fouls. After three fouls the player will be an automatic foul out.

The Timekeeper will determine the length of the game based on scheduling for the day with the minimum of a ROUND ROBIN game or a half being 5 minutes long.

Games will be 2 halves of play.

ROUND ROBIN games will only be 1 half of play.

Basketball will be officiated with common rules found in basketball such as traveling, 5 second inbound, 3 second lane violation, backcourt violation, etc.

If the teams are tied after a full game, a 2 minute overtime will be played and the team with the most points will be the winner.

Touching the back wall at the ends of the court will result in an out-of-bounds call by the referee.

Each team will have 1 time-out of 1 minute in length per half. The clock will run until the final minute of play during which the clock will be stopped each time the play is whistled dead.

There is to be no rough play in this event. Any rough play will result in immediate disqualification of the team. The purpose of this event is to allow the students some fun and fellowship while at the same time teaching teamwork and good sportsmanship.
