Each school is allowed to enter one male team per division.

For those school with fewer than 25 participants, combining students will be allowed between “A” and “B” division.

A team will consist of 3 players plus a goalie.

There will be 5 substitutes allowed for a maximum number of **9 players per team**.

Each player is to wear a numbered jersey. <u>A hockey helmet is a requirement.</u> THOSE NOT WEARING A HOCKEY HELMET WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PLAY. The goalie is encouraged to wear the full complement of goal-tending equipment. Please follow the DRESS CODE for Convention.

An orange plastic puck will be used.

Students must use hockey sticks that have a wooden shaft and a plastic blade.

The length of each stick may not surpass the chin of the player using the stick.

The referee will check every stick before the game and ensure they meet the requirements. If a player is found with a composite stick or a stick that surpasses his chin, he will be given a 1 minute penalty before the game starts. If a player is then found trying to use a disqualified stick, he will be disqualified from the event.

The Timekeeper will determine the length of the game based on the schedule for the day with the minimum for the ROUND ROBIN game of a period of 5 minutes.

Games will be 2 periods in length of 10 minutes each. The time is “no stop” play.

ROUND ROBIN games will only be 1 period in length.

Slap shots are NOT PERMITTED.

A player may NOT have their stick go above the waist.

Floor hockey will be officiated with common rules found in hockey such as tripping, slashing, holding, etc.

Any penalty given will be 1 minute long.

If the teams are tied after a full game, a 1 minute overtime will be played and whoever scores first will win.

If the teams are still tied after the overtime, the winner will be determined by a shootout.

Each team will have 1 time-out of 1 minute in length per period.

The clock will run until the final minute of play during which the clock will be stopped each time the play is whistled dead.

There is to be no body contact or rough play. Any rough play will result in immediate disqualification of the team. The purpose of this event is to allow the students some fun and fellowship while at the same time teaching teamwork and sportsmanship.

Penalties will be given at the referee’s discretion. Any “bad attitude” displayed towards the referee will be seen as grounds for immediate disqualification.

The referee may shorten consolation games due to the scheduling of other events in Convention.
