Each school is allowed to enter 3 students, male or female, per age group.

Poems must be MEMORIZED. Missing 25-34 words will cost the student the gold medal.

Missing 35-49 words will cost the student the silver medal. **Missing 50 words or more will automatically result in a 77 (participation mark)** and the loss of a bronze medal.

Those in Division “A” will be required to recite a poem of 24 lines minimum and those in Division “B” will be required to recite a poem of 32 lines minimum.

See the [General Student Guidelines](/student-guidelines) for appropriate dress.

See the [Platform Guidelines](/student-guidelines/platform) for further instruction.

No costumes are allowed.

No singing is allowed.

The poem should be appropriate for a Christian audience.

The time limit for each recitation is 6 minutes.

A Poetry Recitation is not a one-act play. There is no walking around, and the majority of the gestures should be above the waist.

One copy of the script must be brought to Convention. This copy may not be returned so be sure to retain a copy for yourself.

Please bring 2 copies of the Judge’s Form for Poetry Recitation with you to Convention. Please be sure to fill these out in their entirety. If the Judging Form is not filled out, you may not be judged.
