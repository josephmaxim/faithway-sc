Each school is allowed to enter 2 students, male or female, per age group.

**Each student may submit 1 entry only.**

The entry must be framed and matted with the student’s name, age and school name attached.

Any entries without the student’s name, etc. will not be judged.

The photography should reflect an appropriate Christian theme and not be associated with the world.

**COMPOSITION**

Refers to how the picture is arranged.

The Rule of Thirds has been used for centuries and is probably the most important of all the composition techniques. The Rule of Thirds means that the frame can be divided into three horizontal sections and three vertical sections and therefore, where the horizontal and vertical lines intersect makes an ideal location for the more important parts of your picture. By locating your main subject at one of the four intersections, you give the subject more emphasis than if it was right smack in the middle of the page.

**CENTRE OF INTEREST**

The Centre of Interest is usually the subject of the photograph. It is the part that should catch the viewer’s eye.

Ways to use Centre of Interest:

1. Simplicity is the method of keeping the information in a photograph relatively simple. If your main subject is close, than your background should be very simple to avoid distractions.
2. Framing is the tactic of using natural surroundings to add more meaning to your subject. It could be anything such as bushes, trees, a window, or even a doorway.

**BALANCE**

Objects should be placed in a way that is pleasing and not crowded.

**UNITY / VARIETY**

The subject needs to be organized so that all parts work together as a whole. At the same time, the subject can have a variety in textures, shapes, colours, and contrasts.

**LIGHTING / PROPER EXPOSURE**

Use good lighting and take care to make sure your lighting compliments the main subject.

Be careful your exposure does not over or under expose the object.

**COLOUR / BLACK AND WHITE / SEPIA**

Colours are what add heart and emotion to your pictures.

Certain colour configurations can inspire awe and amazement in onlookers.

Colours can be used to add all sorts of accents and effects, but you must be careful to not draw attention away from the main subject.

Black and white or Sepia can add drama or highlight your subject. It can also make a busy coloured photograph look more simplified.

**CONTRAST**

This could be dark on light or vice versa, or a focused subject against a blurred background or vice versa.

**FOCUS POINTS / PROPORTIONS / PERSPECTIVE**

Make sure your subject stands out sharply.

The subject should usually be dominant and the eye of the viewer should be drawn to it, but it need not be centered.

In portraits, focus on the subject’s eyes and use the zoom if available to frame your subjects.

**PRESENTATION**

The way a photo is presented makes a BIG difference in how the viewer sees it. If the photo is messy and smudged with fingerprints, or if it is poorly mounted and the mat is ragged or falling off, the viewer will not appreciate the picture.

**GENERAL GUIDELINES**

EACH ENTRY MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A NOTE AND A SIGNATURE FROM A SPONSOR (PRESENT AT CONVENTION) VERIFYING THAT THE ENTRY WAS TAKEN BY THE STUDENT.

Please bring 2 copies of the Judge’s Form for Photography with you to Convention. Please be
sure to fill them out in their entirety. If the Judging Form is not filled out, you may not be
judged.
