Each school is allowed to enter 3 participants, male or female, per age group.

An Expressive Reading is a memorized interpretation by an individual of a selection of a dialogue between 2 or more characters, or a monologue, which is a reading in the first person, or a scripture passage (poems may not be included).

Please refer to the [Platform Guidelines](/student-guidelines/platform) for further preparation for this entry.

See the [General Student Guidelines](/student-guidelines) for appropriate dress.

The participant should play the part of an observer or narrator who is reporting the material written by an author directly to an audience. Create an atmosphere by tone of voice, inflections, pauses, and gestures.

Expressive Readings MUST BE MEMORIZED. Missing 50 words or more will result in an immediate 77 (participation mark).

Costumes are not allowed.

Singing is not allowed.

Presentation time is 4-6 minutes for division “A” and 6-8 minutes for division “B.”

An Expressive Reading is not a one-act play. There is no walking around, and the majority of the gestures should be above the waist.

One copy of the script must be brought to Convention. This copy may not be returned so be sure to retain a copy for yourself.

Please bring 2 copies of the Judge’s Form for Expressive Reading with you to Convention.

Please be sure to fill these out in their entirety. If the Judging Form is not filled out, you may not be judged.
