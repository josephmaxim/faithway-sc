Students must create their OWN sermon. Each sermon must have Bible content. Some assistance is allowed from the pastor only. A statement declaring how much assistance was give must accompany the Judging Form.

The time limit will be 8 minutes. This will be strictly adhered to. If a student goes over the set time he will be instructed to take his seat. There will be no preaching after time has been called. To do so will require immediate disqualification.
