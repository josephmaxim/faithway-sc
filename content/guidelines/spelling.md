Each school is allowed to enter 3 students, male or female, per age group.

All students will take a written test to determine the finalists. The finalists may compete in a traditional elimination spell-down.

The rules for the spell-down are as follows:

1. The judge will announce the word, use the word in a sentence, and pronounce the word again.
2. The student will than say the word, spell it, and say the word again.
3. If spelled correctly, the student will remain in the event.
4. If misspelled, the student is eliminated.
5. If the student partially spells the word and has a change of mind, the student must follow rule #2.
6. Once a student has followed through with rule #2 there may not be a change of mind.

All words for the written test will be selected from the list provided each year. Each list will be used in succession for 2-3 years.

Words for the spell-down will be selected from the list, as well as from elsewhere, as the judges deem necessary for elimination.

British or North American spelling will be allowed for the spell-down only. The words chosen for the written test must be spelled exactly as those given on the list.
