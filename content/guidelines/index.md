Christian Student Convention has three basic aims:

1. To glorify God
2. To promote standards of excellence
3. To encourage fellowship and friendship among Christian youth

Seeking to achieve these goals, we are eliminating competition among participants in all but a few elimination events, such as spelling, volleyball, etc. Instead, each participant will compete against a standard and will be rewarded according to how she / he measures up to that standard. In each event there could be several participants, or no participants, who receive the gold. All judging forms will rate the participant on a scale of 1-100 (gold = 93 and above; silver = 85-92; bronze = 78-84). Those who score below 78 will be given a participation mark of 77.

**THE OUTSTANDING STUDENT AWARD**

This award is given to the student in your school with the highest average. This award will be available to those students who have entered at least 5 or more events with 2 being platform events. If your school is unable to enter platform events, the award will go to the student with the highest average.

**THE AWARD OF EXCELLENCE**

This award will go to the student who, out of all the schools entered, has the highest average and who has entered 5 or more events with 2 or more of those events being in platform categories. There will be one Award of Excellence for Division “A” and one Award of Excellence for Division “B.

Christian Student Convention is for full-time students who attend your church school or who are home-schooled and attend your church faithfully.

Those who are 12 years old or in grade 7 on the Convention dates may attend. Students who are younger than 12 may not enter even if they are in grade 7.

Graduating students who may have completed their academic work already in the current school year are eligible.

A student may enter a maximum of **9** participation events EXCLUDING those events finished before Convention (needlework, sketching, etc.).

<u>**A participant must enter a minimum of 3 events.**</u>

Mixing divisions will be allowed for those schools with 25 students or less. Mixing a “B” Division student in an “A” Division group will require that group to be judged and to participate with the “B” Division.

The following dress code will be enforced for all participants, judges, and sponsors. Failure to follow the dress code will result in lost points when being judged and could result in disqualification as well as embarrassment, so please abide!
