Woodworking entries will be those entries made of wood and entirely by the student.

The student will receive points for submitting a design on paper and being able to complete the final product.

The design can be from a book or developed by the student himself.

It is important to clearly identify components purchased and portions made by others so we can clearly judge the student’s work.

All submissions will be judged based on the following: creativity; design; balance; colour; function; accuracy to the design; workmanship; potential marketability.

Judges will keep in mind the age of the student when judging the entry.

Please bring 2 copies of the Judge’s Form for Arts & Crafts and Woodworking with you to Convention. Please be sure to fill these out in their entirety. If the Judging Forms are not filled out, you may not be judged.
