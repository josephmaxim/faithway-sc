Each school is allowed to enter 3 students, male or female, per age group.

The student will be assigned a topic. No student will know the topic until they write the essay.

The time limit is 1 hour. Students may use any facts or examples relevant to the topic chosen. Each student will need a pencil for the rough draft and a pen for the final copy. Paper for the rough draft and final copy will be provided at the time of their test.

Final copy must be done in pen, double-spaced, and in the student’s best handwriting. A one- page written double-spaced essay is approximately 125-150 words. A messy final copy may result in lost points.

Each copy must have the student’s name, church name and age at the top of the first page.

Please bring 2 copies of the Judge’s Form for Essay Writing with you to Convention. Please be sure to fill these out in their entirely. If the Judging Form is not filled out, you may not be judged.
