**APPEARANCE**

Dignity and good grooming should be apparent. Clothing should be clean and neatly pressed; shoes should be shined. Uniformity of dress is recommended for groups but not required. School uniforms are usually proper.

* **BOYS**: a suit of slacks and sport coat, button shirt (tucked in), and tie should be worn. No white socks, blue jeans or running shoes are allowed.

* **GIRLS**: appropriate attire would be a nice dress of the proper length (below the knee) and tailored; dress shoes and nylons.

**POISE / SELF-CONFIDENCE**

* **Approach** - the approach is one of the most important elements of speaking, public recitation or singing. The participant should walk, confidently and briskly, to the podium or the front of the audience. They should establish good eye contact, pause for 5-10 seconds, and being their presentation.

* **Eye Contact** – the student should establish a rapport with the audience with good eye contact. They should avoid looking down often at their notes or Bible, at the ceiling, or out of the window. Eyes should move up and down, back and forth over the entire audience, slowly and naturally.

* **Posture / Gestures** – the rule for posture is DO NOT SLOUCH! The student should stand straight, but not lock-kneed. Gestures should be free and flow naturally from enthusiasm. Natural movements are more effective then forced gestures.

* **Delivery** – the speaker should project his voice, using the diaphragm. Recreate the mood, experience, emotion and feelings of the author. Employ voice variations and tempo.


**PREPARATION**

Preparation and study are prerequisites for all speaking, reading or musical performances. Research, organization, outline, and familiarity are the elements of preparation. Students will receive poor marks from the judges if they are not properly prepared.

**PLATFORM PRESENTATION**

Introduction of entry before the judges: students in platform presentations are to give their first and last names and title of their presentation (My name is John Doe and I will be reciting...).
